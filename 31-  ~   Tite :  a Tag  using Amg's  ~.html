            ~    Title :   Image as link   ~


Image Links:
Using an <a> tag to link an image to another web page or resource is a common practice in web design. This is done by wrapping the <img> element inside an <a> tag. Here’s a concise explanation of how this is implemented:

When you want to link an image to a different page, you surround the <img> tag with an <a> tag and use the href attribute in the <a> tag to specify the destination URL. This makes the image act as a clickable link, allowing users to navigate to the specified URL when they click on the image.

For example:

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive Text">
</a>

In this setup:

The href attribute points to the URL where you want the user to go when they click on the image.
The target="_blank" attribute is optional but can be used to open the linked page in a new browser tab,
keeping your site open in the original tab. This is particularly useful for keeping users engaged with your 
site while also directing them to additional information or external content.
This method is widely used for various purposes, such as advertising banners, gallery images, or any visual 
content that you want to link to other parts of your site or to external sites. It enhances the interactivity
of images and can improve navigation and user experience on your website.
