        Comments will slow the page!!!!

• HTML comments do indeed contribute to the
overall size of an HTML document, as they are
part of the text content that gets loaded by
browsers. However, the impact of comments on
page load speed is typically very minimal unless
the document contains an excessive amount of
comment text.

• HTML comments are a powerful tool for developers to make their code more understandable and easier to manage.

They allow for better documentation of the codebase and can simplify the debugging and development process 
by enabling developers to temporarily disable parts of the HTML without deleting them.

Proper use of comments can significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of web projects.

While HTML comments do add some amount of data to your files, their impact on page loading speed is typically very small unless you have a lot of comments.

Good management practices and modern web optimization techniques like minification and compression effectively mitigate any potential negative effects.
For most websites, the benefits of using comments for code clarity and maintenance outweigh the very slight performance costs.
