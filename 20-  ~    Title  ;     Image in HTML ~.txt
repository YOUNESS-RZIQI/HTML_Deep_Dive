<!--                   ~  Title :  Image in HTML  ~


        The <img> tag is used in web pages to display images.
        It does not have a closing tag and works using attributes.
        And it is a inline element

        Attributes Examples:
        src    -> Specifies the path or URL of the image.
        alt    -> Provides alternative text if the image cannot load (accessibility).
        title  -> Shows extra information when hovering over the image.
        width  -> Sets the width of the image.
        height -> Sets the height of the image.
