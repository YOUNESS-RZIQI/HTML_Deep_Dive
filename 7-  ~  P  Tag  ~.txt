Using <p> tags for paragraphs rather than multiple <br> tags
to separate blocks of text is generally considered better
practice for several important reasons:

1) Semantic Meaning
The <p> tag provides semantic meaning to the text by defining
it as a paragraph.
This helps search engines and accessibility tools, like screen
readers, understand and interpret the structure of the content
more effectively.
Semantic HTML is crucial for SEO and accessibility, making your
content more discoverable and usable.

2) Maintaining Document Structure
Paragraph tags help maintain a clear structure within the
document.
This structure aids both users and developers in understanding
how content is organized.
Each <p> element creates a new block-level element, signifying
a distinct section of text,
whereas <br> tags simply break lines without indicating any
structural division.

3) Styling and CSS
When using <p> tags, it’s easier to apply CSS styles
consistently.
You can manage margins, padding, line-height, text alignment,
and other typographical aspects
in a way that is consistent across all browsers and devices.
Conversely, using <br> tags to separate text doesn't provide
the same level of control over styling
and can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges.

4) Readability and Maintenance
Code readability improves when using <p> tags because the
purpose of each section of text is clearer.
This is particularly helpful in the maintenance phase of a
website,
as developers can quickly understand how text is grouped and
structured.
<br> tags used excessively can clutter the HTML document,
making it difficult to read and maintain.

5) Accessibility
Accessibility tools rely on a well-structured document to
navigate and interpret content correctly.
<p> tags are essential as they define the logical flow of the
document.
Using <br> tags excessively can disrupt the flow,
making it harder for people using screen readers to understand
the context of the content.

6) Avoiding Bad Practices
Using <br> tags to create space between paragraphs is
considered a bad practice
because it mixes content with presentation.
The separation of content from presentation is a fundamental
web design principle,
achieved by using HTML for structure (like <p> tags for
paragraphs)
and CSS for presentation (like spacing and layout).

7) Conclusion
Overall, while <br> tags are useful for specific purposes like
creating line breaks within a paragraph
or in elements like poems or addresses,
<p> tags are generally better for separating larger blocks of
text.
This practice aligns with modern web standards,
promoting accessibility, maintainability,
and a cleaner, more semantic HTML structure.
