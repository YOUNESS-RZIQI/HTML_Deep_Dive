                        ~  Title : HTML < small > 

        
        The small tag is used to make specific text appear smaller than normal, and it has less importance.
        Therefore, the small tag does have a semantic meaning.

<!-- • The HTML <small> tag is used to denote smaller
text size in HTML documents, but its purpose
extends beyond just visual presentation.
• This tag is meant to indicate side comments,
small print, or any fine details that are not
the main focus of the document but still require
inclusion for completeness. -->
