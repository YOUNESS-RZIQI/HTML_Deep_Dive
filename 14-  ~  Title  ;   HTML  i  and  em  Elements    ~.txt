<!-- Both <i> and <em> tags italicize text but serve different functions. 
<i> is used for text that requires a different typographical
presentation without additional emphasis, such as foreign words, names of ships,
or creative thought. In contrast, <em> is used to indicate that the enclosed text 
should be stressed due to its importance or urgency in the context.

Understanding these differences is crucial for effective communication and accessibility in web design. -->
