Detailed Process Breakdown

1- Parsing HTML:

• As the browser parses the HTML document, it constructs the DOM (Document Object Model).

• During this parsing, whenever it encounters an  tag, it recognizes a resource that

needs to be fetched. The parsing continues while these resources are being noted for

fetching.

2- Sending Request:

• As soon as the browser encounters an  tag with a src attribute during the HTML

parsing, it sends an HTTP request for the image, even if it hasn't finished parsing the

entire document.

• This is typically done asynchronously, meaning that the browser doesn’t need to wait for

the image to be downloaded to continue processing the HTML.

3- Downloading Image:

• Image files are downloaded in the background, allowing the browser to continue with other

tasks such as parsing the rest of the HTML, loading CSS and JavaScript, and rendering

content that has already been processed.

• The downloading process does not block the browser from performing these other tasks

unless specifically instructed to do so (e.g., by scripts that wait for an event related

to the image).
