            ~   Title :  a tag and target attribute.   ~


    Introduction:

        • Hyperlinks, or links, are fundamental to the web. They
        connect various resources, allowing users to navigate
        from one web page to another, download files, or jump to
        specific sections within a page.
        • The <a> tag, short for "anchor," is one of the most
        fundamental and powerful elements in HTML.
        • It is used to create hyperlinks, which are essential for
        navigating between web pages, linking to external sites,
        or jumping to specific parts of a page.
        • This lesson focuses specifically on using the <a> tag to
        link to external websites, which is a common practice in
        web development for connecting your site's content with
        other resources on the web.
