<!-- Concept Explanation
• <mark> Tag: The <mark> tag is designed to
represent text that should be visually
highlighted for reference or navigation
purposes.
• It's often used to indicate a part of a text
that is relevant in a particular context, such
as during searches or in instructional content.
The default style for the <mark> tag is usually
a yellow background, similar to how text might
be highlighted with a marker on paper, though
this can be styled differently with CSS. -->
