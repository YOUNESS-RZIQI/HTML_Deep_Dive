<!-- While both the <b> and <strong> tags render text in bold, choosing between them 
should be based on the intended meaning rather than appearance. 
Use <b> for stylistic boldness and <strong> when the text's importance or urgency needs
to be communicated, especially to assistive technologies.

This distinction helps ensure that web content is accessible and semantically appropriate. -->
